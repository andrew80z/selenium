# Copilot Instructions

This project uses GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat to assist with code generation, explanations, and productivity enhancements. 

## Usage Guidelines
- Use Copilot suggestions to accelerate coding, but always review and test generated code.
- For questions or explanations, use Copilot Chat in the sidebar.
- Sensitive or proprietary information should not be entered into prompts.

## Best Practices
- Validate Copilot-generated code with unit tests.
- Follow DRY
- Use POM for test organization.
- do not hardcode values; use configuration files or environment variables.
- store data in data folder as JSON files
- Use clear, descriptive comments to help Copilot understand your intent.
- Regularly update dependencies and review Copilot's suggestions for security and correctness.

## Troubleshooting
- If Copilot is not responding, ensure your extension is up to date and you are signed in with a GitHub account.
